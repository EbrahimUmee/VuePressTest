# Joining Mainnet

The current Umee mainnet, `umee-1`, launched February 15th at 17:00 UTC. The current version of `umeed` running on mainnet is v1.0.x. For the genesis file and a list of peers, please visit [here](https://github.com/umee-network/umee/tree/main/networks/umee-1). Please see either the [Full Node](full-node.md) or [Validator](validator.md) for instructions on how to start and operate an `umeed` node.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note, node operators, regardless if a full node or a validator, syncing a new node from genesis must either use version v1.0.1 or v1.0.2 until block height 24,615. After height 24,615 operators must switch to v1.0.3+.
