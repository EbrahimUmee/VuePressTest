# New Asset Listing

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Anyone can submit a new asset listing proposal through **<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_
{% endhint %}

Umee allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. Adding more assets introduces more risk to the protocol, so it is important that anyone who wishes to propose a new asset on Umee has reviewed the asset risk documentation and is prepared to acknowledge:

* The increased risk of insolvency that comes along with listing a new asset;&#x20;
* Centralized asset risk;&#x20;
* Magnified risks associated with collateral assets;&#x20;
* Market diversification.
