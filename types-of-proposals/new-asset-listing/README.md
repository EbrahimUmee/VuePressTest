# ðŸ†• New Asset Listing

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Anyone can submit a new asset listing proposal through **<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark>_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_
{% endhint %}

Umee allows users to lend and borrow a wide variety of assets across chains in a trustless manner. Adding more assets introduces more risk to the protocol, so it is important that anyone who wishes to propose a new asset on Umee has reviewed the asset risk documentation and is prepared to acknowledge:

* The increased risk of insolvency that comes along with listing a new asset;&#x20;
* Centralized asset risk;&#x20;
* Magnified risks associated with collateral assets;&#x20;
* Market diversification.

## 1) Research&#x20;

Before proposing a new asset to be listed on Umee, it's incredibly important to research the asset and have a strong understanding of how it works, why it can be considered safe, and how it will benefit Umee users.

Community members should be able to answer all of the basic questions found in the "[_<mark style="color:blue;">**New Asset Listing Template**</mark>_](new-asset-listing-template.md)" before moving on to step 2.

## 2) Create the Proposal

{% tab title="2.3) Engage" %}
## Engage With the Community

**Once the drafted proposal has been shared on Commonwealth, the author should:**

* Encourage key community members (well respected contributors, validators, large stakers, etc.) to share their questions, concerns and/or constructive criticism.
* Spread the word to bring attention to the proposal. Use tools like Twitter, Discord, Telegram, and Reddit to alert the community.
* Answer relevant questions on the [<mark style="color:blue;">governance forum</mark>](https://commonwealth.im/umee/) and the #governance-discussion channel on the [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee Discord</mark>](https://discord.gg/umee).

If the communityâ€™s feedback and the off-chain poll demonstrate clear support for the new asset listing request, the Umee Team will work with the community to perform an in-depth risk assessment and create a risk score and recommendation for the asset in question.

If the communityâ€™s feedback and the off-chain poll demonstrate clear support for the new asset listing request, the Umee Team will assist the community to performing an in-depth risk assessment and create a risk score and recommendation for the asset in question.

A proper risk analysis will score the asset based off of things like smart-contract risk, counterparty Risk, and overall risk with accompanying research-backed explanations.

## 3) Submit the Proposal On-Chain
