# ðŸ’¸ Foundation Spend Proposals

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Foundation Spend Proposals.jpg>)

Foundation Spend Proposals are used to request funds from the [<mark style="color:blue;">community & ecosystem pools</mark>](https://docs.umee.cc/umee/umee-overview/the-umee-token#community) to be sent to a specific wallet address. How community pool and ecosystem pool funds are spent is entirely up to community governance decisions.&#x20;

#### A few ways in which the funds might be spent include:

* _**Creating and funding various Umee DAOs;**_&#x20;
* _**Liquidity mining incentives;**_&#x20;
* _**Funding large scale community events;**_&#x20;
* _**Grants to top contributors;**_&#x20;
* _**Strategically acquiring crypto assets to gain voting power in key protocols;**_&#x20;
* _**Burning mechanisms.**_
