# ðŸ’¸ Foundation Spend Proposals

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Anyone can submit a foundation spend proposal through**_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_
{% endhint %}

Foundation Spend Proposals are used to request funds from the <mark style="color:blue;">community & ecosystem pools</mark> to be sent to a specific wallet address. How community pool and ecosystem pool funds are spent is entirely up to community governance decisions.&#x20;

#### A few ways in which the funds might be spent include:

* _**Creating and funding various Umee DAOs;**_&#x20;
* _**Liquidity mining incentives;**_&#x20;
* _**Funding large scale community events;**_&#x20;
* _**Grants to top contributors;**_&#x20;
* _**Strategically acquiring crypto assets to gain voting power in key protocols;**_&#x20;
* _**Burning mechanisms.**_
