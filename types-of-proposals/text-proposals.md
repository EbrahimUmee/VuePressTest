Text proposals are an on chain representation, or signaling mechanism, for events that may happen off-chain. Unlike parameter change proposals and community spend proposals, the results of text proposals are not actually enforceable - though they should always be respected. Text proposals can be used for things like the formation of DAOs or other events that cannot be directly programmed.
