## **To Transfer Tokens to Umee:**

**On the "**[<mark style="color:blue;">**Markets**</mark>](https://testnet.umee.cc/#/markets)**" page, select your network of choice.**&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
_**When "Cosmos" is selected, tokens will be transferred from their native chain to the Umee blockchain with the exception of native UMEE tokens which are already on the Umee blockchain.**_
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
_**When "Ethereum" is selected, tokens will be transferred from the Umee blockchain to Ethereum.**_
{% endhint %}

![For this example we will be transferring tokens to the Umee blockchain, so "Cosmos" is selected.](<../../.gitbook/assets/select network.png>)



**Identify which asset you’d like to transfer on to Umee and select “Transfer” in the appropriate row.**&#x20;

![For this example we will be transferring ATOM from the Cosmos Hub.](<../../.gitbook/assets/select asset to transfer.png>)
