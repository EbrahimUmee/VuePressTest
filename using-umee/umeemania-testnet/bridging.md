# Bridging

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Before bridging make sure you have testnet UMEE in your Umee wallet and testnet ETH in your Ethereum wallet for gas fees. See "**_[_<mark style="color:blue;">**Using Testnet Faucets**</mark>_](using-testnet-faucets.md)_**" for more information.**_
{% endhint %}

## To Bridge Between Umee & Ethereum:

**Make sure your Umee and Ethereum wallets are both connected to the web app, and your Ethereum wallet is connected to the "Goerli Test Network."**

**On the markets page, change the toggle switch in the upper right corner to the ecosystem you'd like to transfer TO.**

![For this example we will be transferring tokens to the Ethereum ecosystem, so "Ethereum" is selected.](<../../.gitbook/assets/toggle to network you'd like to transfer TO.png>)



**Identify which asset you’d like to transfer, and select the “Transfer” button in the appropriate row.**

![For this example we will be transferring ATOM from Umee to Ethereum.](<../../.gitbook/assets/select asset you'd like to transfer.png>)



**On the top of the pop-up, select which network you’re transferring tokens TO.**
