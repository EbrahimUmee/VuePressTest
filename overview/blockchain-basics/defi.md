## What Is Decentralized Finance?

_**Decentralized finance, or “DeFi,” is a term used to describe a wide range of decentralized financial services made possible by blockchain technology.**_

<details>

<summary><strong>Trustless</strong></summary>

Traditional financial services rely on intermediaries like banks to facilitate any and all transactions. These intermediaries have the power to dictate how and when users can access and use their own money.&#x20;

Thanks to blockchain technology, DeFi allows users to “be their own bank.” When interacting with DeFi services users maintain full control over their assets without the need to trust a centralized intermediary.

<summary>Accessible</summary>

Many people worldwide are unable to experience the benefits provided by traditional financial services for a wide range of reasons including but not limited to their location, level of income, or credit score.

Anyone with an internet connection can access DeFi services. Blockchain technology allows DeFi services to be completely permissionless, meaning users do not need to apply and be approved to gain access to financial services.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Transparent</summary>

Traditional financial services typically give users little to no visibility on their processes.&#x20;

On the blockchain everything is auditable and transparent. Users can know exactly what risks they are taking on when using any DeFi service. Additionally, users cannot be discriminated against; everyone can access the same opportunities and rates regardless of their financial background.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Convenient</summary>

Traditional financial services can be slow, expensive, and inconvenient in general. Traditional financial service providers often tack on unnecessary fees for simple services that users have no choice but to pay.&#x20;

Since no intermediaries are needed in DeFi, financial services can be offered at a much lower cost for the user. Financial transactions are fast and simple, the way that they should be.

## What Is a Decentralized Exchange?

Traditionally, centralized exchanges are needed to facilitate the trading of financial assets between two parties. A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a decentralized marketplace where financial assets can be traded in a permissionless and trustless manner. DEXs are accessible by anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet, with no sign up or KYC needed. Decentralized exchanges allow users to maintain full control over their assets, unlike centralized exchanges which take custody over all assets deposited. Since there is no intermediary needed, trading fees are often significantly cheaper on a decentralized exchange than a centralized exchange.

## Lending & Borrowing in DeFi

In finance, loans are issued in two ways: credit or over-collateralization. Most of the time a DeFi lending and borrowing protocol such as Umee issues loans based on over-collateralization. DeFi users typically have to post one crypto asset as collateral in order to borrow another. This means that no credit check, trust, or personal information is needed for a loan to be issued.

While borrowers have a certain amount of crypto assets posted as collateral, the lending platform simultaneously uses the asset to lend to other borrowers so that the assets are being utilized to generate lending interest, thus increasing overall capital efficiency. Lending platforms usually set up their own [<mark style="color:blue;">risk framework</mark>](../../additional-information/asset-risk.md) <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> to keep a healthy loan to value ratio and liquidation threshold based on each crypto asset’s property to withhold market volatility.

## Lending

In DeFi, lenders can choose to deposit any amount they wish to the lending protocol at any time. In Umee, there are no fees depositors need to pay apart from the transaction fees to post their transactions on chain, similar to any DeFi protocol. After depositing, lenders can enjoy a passive lending yield.

{% tab title="Borrowing" %}
## Borrowing

In order to borrow in DeFi, borrowers must first deposit assets as collateral. After the collateral has been deposited, borrowers can select any asset to borrow. The amount a borrower can borrow is determined by the amount of collateral the borrower posts and the loan to value ratio of the specific asset.

Borrowing interest rates usually float based on the total amounts borrowed and available to be borrowed from the pool in real time. Borrowers must pay off their loan plus interest in the form of the asset borrowed in order to withdraw all of their collateral.

{% tab title="LTV Ratio" %}
## Loan to Value Ratio

The loan to value ratio is commonly used by a lending platform to monitor the health of each collateralized loan position.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**The loan to value ratio represents the value of the asset borrowed against the health of each collateralized loan position.**_
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Repayment" %}
## Repayment

When it comes to paying off DeFi loans, borrowers don’t have a deadline to make payments. As long as borrowers’ loan to value ratios remain in check they can choose when to pay off their loan at whatever pace they desire.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Liquidations" %}
## Liquidations

Since DeFi borrowers need to over-collateralize their loans, it’s important that they maintain a healthy over-collateralized position or they risk being liquidated.

Liquidations occur when a borrower’s loan to value ratio increases above a required threshold before an under-collateralized loan position occurs. The liquidation mechanism makes sure that the loans can always be repaid in full to protect the safety of the lenders’ assets.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Borrowers can take steps to decrease their chances of being liquidated by doing things like:**_&#x20;

* _**Borrowing smaller amounts relative to collateral provided;**_&#x20;
* _**Depositing more collateral as the loan to value ratio becomes less healthy;**_
* _**Making payments on the loan as the loan to value ratio becomes less healthy.**_
