# Token Format

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Token Format.png>)

**The UMEE token exists in two forms: an Umee blockchain native version (the native UMEE token), and an ERC-20 token version native to Ethereum.** The two forms of UMEE tokens can be freely converted to one another through the Umee Gravity Bridge, accessible on the Umee web app.

### The Native UMEE Token

_**The main purpose of the native UMEE token** is to participate in the PoS consensus mechanism to help secure the Umee blockchain and earn PoS staking yield, pay gas fees on the Umee blockchain to execute Umeeâ€™s cross chain DeFi transactions, and to be able to vote and participate in protocol governance decisions._



**You are in possession of the **_**native UMEE token**_** native to the Umee blockchain if any of the following are true:**

* Your tokens are stored in an Umee blockchain compatible wallet like Keplr.
* You purchased UMEE on a Cosmos-based decentralized exchange.
* You bridged UMEE from Ethereum to the Umee blockchain.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ERC-20 UMEE Token" %}
### The ERC-20 UMEE Token

_**The main purpose of the ERC-20 UMEE token** is to create a user-friendly experience for Umee to tap into the DeFi legos on Ethereum and allow  people to seamlessly access the UMEE token as an ERC-20 token and hold or trade it on centralized exchanges._



**You are in possession of the **_**ERC-20 UMEE token**_** native to the Ethereum blockchain if any of the following are true:**

* Your tokens are stored in an Ethereum wallet like MetaMask.
* You purchased UMEE on an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.
* You bridged UMEE from the Umee blockchain to Ethereum.
