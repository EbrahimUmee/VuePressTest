# Creating a Proposal

## Before Drafting a Proposal

It’s very important that community members discuss their ideas and receive thorough feedback before starting the proposal process. Some things to take into consideration include:

* How will this proposal benefit the Umee community?&#x20;
* Are there any significant risks associated with the proposal?&#x20;
* Which stakeholders will be impacted the most?&#x20;
* Acknowledging the opposition is always important.

Community members can start by discussing their ideas within any of Umee’s community channels; the channels within <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee’s Governance Forum</mark>](https://commonwealth.im/umee/), and/or the [<mark style="color:blue;">#discussion channel</mark>](https://discord.com/invite/YukEZy8nkc) in the Governance section of the Umee Discord are both good places to start.

It's **** always a good idea to take a temperature check before submitting an on-chain proposal since on-chain proposals require a deposit which can be lost if [<mark style="color:blue;">certain conditions outlined here</mark>](governance-process.md#the-deposit-period) are not met. Criticism needs to be taken seriously in order for a proposal to be successful. By actively answering questions and engaging with the community about your idea, it will be more clear if your idea is ready to be crafted into a proposal or not.

## Drafting a Proposal

When drafting a proposal, community members should identify the [<mark style="color:blue;">type of proposal</mark>](types-of-proposals.md) they will be submitting and use the correct formatting. Attention to detail is important, because once a proposal has been submitted on-chain it can no longer be changed.

After drafting the proposal, it’s time to share it with the community. Share completed proposal drafts in the “Proposal Discussion” channel on [<mark style="color:blue;">Umee’s Governance Forum</mark>](https://commonwealth.im/umee/), alongside an off chain poll to gauge sentiment.&#x20;

_**When sharing a drafted proposal on the governance forum, please be sure to use the “Drafted: Pre-Voting” topic tag to help make the draft easily visible.**_&#x20;

Once a proposal has been shared on the “Proposal Discussion” channel, it’s time to start engaging with the community and collecting feedback. Challengers should be welcomed, and all legitimate questions should be addressed.
