## Foundation Spend Proposals

_**Anyone can submit a foundation spend proposal through**_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_
{% endhint %}

A total of 46% of the genesis supply of UMEE tokens are allocated to the community, and an additional 9% is allocated to the ecosystem. There is a 2% community tax on all staking rewards that will be used to further fund the community pool; this rate can be altered by community governance through a parameter change. Umee community governance participants will use foundation spend proposals to determine how these tokens are used. You can read more about the community and ecosystem pools and their vesting details in the “[<mark style="color:blue;">Tokenomics</mark>](../the-umee-token/tokenomics.md)” section.

How community pool and ecosystem pool funds are spent is entirely up to community governance decisions. A few ways in which the funds might be spent include:

* Creating and funding various Umee DAOs;&#x20;
* Liquidity mining incentives;&#x20;
* Funding large scale community events;&#x20;
* Grants to top contributors;&#x20;
* Strategically acquiring crypto assets to gain voting power in key protocols;&#x20;
* Burning mechanisms.

## Text Proposals

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Anyone can submit a text proposal through**_ [_<mark style="color:blue;">**Umee's governance forum**</mark>_](https://commonwealth.im/umee/)_**.**_
{% endhint %}

Text proposals are an on chain representation, or signaling mechanism, for events that may happen off-chain. Unlike parameter change proposals and community spend proposals the results of text proposals are not actually enforceable, though they should always be respected. Text proposals can be used for things like the formation of DAOs or other events that cannot be directly programmed.

## Parameter Change Proposals

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**Parameter change proposals require significant technical knowledge.**_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Whenever a change is being made to the protocol, a parameter change proposal needs to pass through the governance process. Parameter change proposals can be made for altering things like:

* Inflation parameters;
* Staking parameters;
* Governance parameters;
* Distribution parameters;
* Slashing parameters.

Parameter change proposals need to be carefully reviewed and discussed since they will be automatically executed once passed. <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> [_<mark style="color:blue;">Umee's active parameters can be viewed here</mark>_](https://ping.pub/umee).
