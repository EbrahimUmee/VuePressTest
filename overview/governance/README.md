# ðŸ“œ Governance

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Umee Governance Infographic.png>)

Umee will use an on-chain governance structure for text proposals, changes in consensus parameters, and the use of funds from the community and ecosystem pools. Governance proposals are voted on by community members who stake UMEE; when community members who stake their UMEE fail to vote before a deadline, their vote is granted to the validator they have delegated their stake to. [_<mark style="color:blue;">You can learn how to vote on a governance proposal here</mark>_](../../using-umee/participating-in-governance.md).

Since Umeeâ€™s governance takes place on-chain, the results of votes are always visible by everyone. Additionally, votes can trigger on-chain events that can not be stopped by any single person or group of people including the Umee core team.

Umee aims to make the governance process as easy and accessible as possible. If you have any suggestions, please share them with the community in the [<mark style="color:blue;">#suggestions</mark>](https://discord.gg/9Mw2nJW9Kv) channel on the Umee Discord server.
